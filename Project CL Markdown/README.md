# 1. What Project CL is all about.

Hello, *Project CL* is a connection website. This means it is to connect all children or teenagers in the tech industry or science industry to help me create a chip. 

# 2. What is this chip?

In rural areas, in Africa and other places there is shortage of electricity, water, wifi, and other important stuff. So this chip would be able to power a town's electricity and give enough wifi to a city. This chip would be powered by the sun and can be plugged into any electrical device.

# 3. What would be my profit? 
 
 When we are done with this chip:
 - The authorities of the town or province would have to pay us for it.
 - Other towns or countries would be intrested in this project and would like to buy it.
 - This chip would go a long way so we may be remembered for it.
 - It will make the world more digital and show them we are ready for more complex tasks.

 1. Be above **five years**
 2. Be ready for **failures and put downs**
